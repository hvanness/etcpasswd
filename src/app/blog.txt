                 but of course we collapse the wavefunction when we measure its location

                     because we exist in a slice of reality


  Imagine if every collapsed state also happens

         and each one propagates




     Then we would only ever have access to the state that came from a collapsed one we experienced.

      In fact we only ever experience a chain of collapsed states.

        But we can choose to not experience a part of the world in order to let it evolve naturally.

          So any collapsed states within that part of the worlds (sic) are inaccessible to us.

            Somewhat ironically, we are only able to exist in a world that is quantum, not classical, half the time
